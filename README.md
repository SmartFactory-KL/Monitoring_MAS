# Monitoring_MAS

This GitHub repository contains the code for the paper "Towards exchanging monitoring data in flexible and distributed factory organization structures". The goal of this paper is to develop a general approach to exchange monitoring data in a I4.0 compliant way. One part of the paper is the development of an AAS template for the distribution of monitoring data (see the provided AAS file). Furthermore, the paper presents three independent case studies that apply the core ideas of the paper. The uncertainty propagation case study computes a fused uncertainty from different distributed resources in a smart factory. The scheduling case study deals with the definition of a resilient multi-level scheduling and control approach. The third case study describes a fault case study that enables distributed fault detection by documenting detected deviations, their severity, affected components, and links to relevant sensor data. The installation of each case study is described in the respective readme file.
